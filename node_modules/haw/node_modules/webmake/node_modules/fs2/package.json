  "readme": "# fs2 - Node.js fs package extensions\n\nFunctions that extend and complement Node.js fs package\n\n_Originally derived from [node-ext](https://github.com/medikoo/node-ext) package._\n\n## Installation\n\n\t$ npm install fs2\n\n## API\n### chmod(path, mode[, cb])\n\nSame as [fs.chmod](http://nodejs.org/api/all.html#all_fs_lchmod_path_mode_callback). Returns promise.\n\nNot available on Windows.\n\n### copy(src, dest[, options, cb])\n\nCopy file, returns promise but accepts as well regular callback.\nEventual options are passed to underlying [fs.createWriteStream](http://nodejs.org/api/all.html#all_fs_createwritestream_path_options)\n\n### descriptorsHandler()\n\nInitializes _EMFILE_ errors prevention.  \nHow it works? If limit of descriptors is reached it holds the calls to native functions and releases them when taken descriptors are freed.\n\nInternally it provides same solution as [fs-graceful](https://github.com/isaacs/node-graceful-fs) module with following differences:\n\n1. Focuses only on file descriptors limit problem\n2. Gives access to taken/available descriptors count and allows setting of limit by external module. Thanks to that we can also cover descriptors opened by fs.watch module ([watch](#watchpath) is bound to that module)\n3. Covers readdir calls (which also happen to throw _EMFILE_ errors)\n4. More bulletproof (I assume) error handling logic\n\n### isIgnored(mode, path[, options][, cb])\n\nWhether file is ignored up to predefined rules. Returns promise but regular callback is also supported.\n\nRules are decided by _mode_ argument. Currently only `git` mode is supported, in that case rules are searched in _.gitignore_ files (Rules have effect only if placed in valid _git_ repositories).\nOther modes can be easily configured by extending `_ignoreModes` module (See _lib/fs/\\_ignore-modes_ directory to see how it's done).\n\nSupported options:\n* __globalRules__ `string|array` - additional global rules. They will be matched as if placed in filesystem root directory, it means that any rules found in existing ignore files may override them.\n* __watch__ `bool` - whether to watch for changes. If ignore state would change, returned promise would emit `change` event with new value (_true_/_false_)\n\n### lchmod(path, mode[, cb])\n\nSame as [fs.lchmod](http://nodejs.org/api/all.html#all_fs_lchmod_path_mode_callback). Returns promise.\n\nOnly available on Mac OS X.\n\n### lstat(path[, cb])\n\nSame as [fs.lstat](http://nodejs.org/api/all.html#all_fs_lstat_path_callback). Returns promise.\n\n### mkdir(path[, options|mode][, cb])\n\nExtended version of native _mkdir_. Returns promise\n\nSupported options:\n* __mode__ - Reflects _mode_ in [native version](http://nodejs.org/api/all.html#all_fs_mkdir_path_mode_callback)\n* __intermediate__ - Whether to create directories recursively (if parent is not created), reflects `mkir -p`, internal implementation inspired by [Substack's node-mkdirp](https://github.com/substack/node-mkdirp/)\n\n### readFile(path[, options][, cb])\n\nExtended version of native [fs.readFile](http://nodejs.org/api/all.html#all_fs_readfile_filename_encoding_callback). Returns promise\n\nSupported options:\n* __loose__ - Do not error if file doesn't exits or is inaccessible, return _null_ instead.\n* __watch__ - Whether to watch file for changes. Changes are emited via _change_ event on returned promise. If file was removed and _loose_ option is off, _end_ event is emitted and watcher is closed\n\n### readdir(path[, options][, cb])\n\nExtended version of native [fs.readdir](http://nodejs.org/api/all.html#all_fs_readdir_path_callback). Returns promise\n\nSuported options:\n* __depth__ `number`- Level of recurse into subdirectories. Defaults to _0_ which resembles behavior of native version. If you want to recurse without any nest limitation just provide _Infinity_\n* __type__ `object`- Which type of files should be returned. By default all files are returned. [Stats methods](http://nodejs.org/api/all.html#all_class_fs_stats) shows how many different types can be returned. To narrow it down provide a hash. e.g. `{ file: true, symbolicLink: true }`.\n* __pattern__ `regexp`- Filter returned files by specific pattern. Pattern should be regular expression that would be matched against full path.\n* __watch__ `bool` - Watch directory for changes. Changes are emitted with `data` events, listeners are called with _event_ object which states which files were added (`event.added`) and which were removed (`event.removed`), ___Starting from next release (v0.4) this functionality will be provided as valid Node.js [stream](http://nodejs.org/api/all.html#all_stream)___\n* __stream__ `bool` - Whether to provide data continuously. Currently it's not provided as [stream](http://nodejs.org/api/all.html#all_stream) per se (it would be starting from next release, v0.4). Currently data is emited as `data` events with _event_ objects described under _watch_ option\n* __ignoreRules__ `string|array` - Whether to obey ignore rules found in ignore files. See _[fs.isIgnored](#isignoredmode-path-options-cb)_ for more information\n* __globalRules__ `string|array` - Global rules that complement ignoreRules. See _[fs.isIgnored](#isignoredmode-path-options-cb)_ for more information.\n\n### rmdir(path[, options][, cb])\n\nExtended version of native _rmdir_. Returns promise\n\nSupported options:\n* __recursive__ - Attempt to remove directory with subdirectories recursively.\n* __force__ - Attempt to remove other files within directory as well.\n\n### typeByStats(stats)\n\nReturns type of file according to provided [stats](http://nodejs.org/api/all.html#all_class_fs_stats) object.\n\n### unlink(path[, cb])\n\nSame as [fs.unlink](http://nodejs.org/api/all.html#all_fs_unlink_path_callback). Returns promise.\n\n### watchPath(path)\n\nWatch specific path for changes. It's about observing specific file path (not directory content). `change` events are emitted with event object where `event.type` says wether file was created, modified or removed.\n\n### watch(path)\n\nWatch file for changes.  \n[fs.watch](http://nodejs.org/api/all.html#all_fs_watch_filename_options_listener) wrapper that works same way on every platform, always configured in _persistent: false_ mode.\nIt's aware of open file descriptors limitations, if _EMFILE_ error is approach, switch to alternative mode that pings file stats (see [fs.watchFile](http://nodejs.org/api/all.html#all_fs_watchfile_filename_options_listener)) is made.\n\n\n### writeFile(filename, data[, encoding][, callback])\n\nSame as native [fs.writeFile](http://nodejs.org/api/all.html#all_fs_writefile_filename_data_encoding_callback) but safe for simultaneous calls of write to same file (in such case current write will be abandonded, and new would be started).\n\n## Tests [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/medikoo/fs2.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/medikoo/fs2)\n\n\t$ npm test\n",
